JsCast
======

JsCast is a web application for playing slideshows synchronized to an audio track.  It is similar to a screencast, except that instead of a recorded video the animations are generated using JavaScript; or, if you prefer, similar to a podcast but with a HTML slide deck.  Hence the name JsCast (pronounced jazz-cast).
